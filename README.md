# Election_Analysis

## Working with Python
This is an analysis of congressional election results in multiple counties using Python.

### Overview of Project
The purpose of this analysis is to determine the winning congressional candidate of this election. This is to be
completed by calculating the total votes for each candidate. The winning candidate is the candidate with the most votes.
The votes can also be viewed based on percentages and sorted by each participating county.

## Election-Audit Results

- How many votes were cast in this congressional election?

Total votes cast were 369,711 votes.

## Election-Audit Summary 

In summation, the script written to perform the analysis for this congressional election was able to successfully
determine the winning candidate, winning percentage and total votes counted for this candidate. This script was also
able to calculate total votes cast across all counties, as well as produce a list of votes sorted by their county origin
and for each candidate. This script presents the most relevant information from the election in an easy-to-read, minimalist
layout.

With some tailoring, this script can be customized to successfully analyze the results of other elections. One such example
of a modification that could be made to this script would be the addition of more lists and dictionaries to accommodate
elections with more candidates and inclusive of more counties. Another modification that could be made to tailor this
script is to specify the party affiliation for the candidates. This would be important information to analyize especially
in larger elections.
